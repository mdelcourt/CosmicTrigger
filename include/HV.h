/**<
 * 
 * \brief High voltage controll class.
 * 
 * This class allows to communicate with a HS CAENET device and was created to control a High voltage unit.
 * 
 * Unlike other vmeBoard objects, it uses 2 different addresses. The main address is the bridge's address and can be set using the switches on the board (see datasheets for details). The second address is the module's address.
 * 
 * In the case of the High Voltage unit, that address can be set by typing F99# Add # on the unit. 
 * 
 * 
 *   
 * Here are the data sheets for the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33459975/cosmicTrigger/datasheets/n470_rev3.pdf">CAENET controller</a> and for the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33459975/cosmicTrigger/datasheets/v288_rev0.pdf">High voltage source</a>.
