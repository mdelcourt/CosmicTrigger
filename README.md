## What is this?

This is a library developped in order to simplify the control of a VME system used to provide a cosmic trigger to a GLIB board.

A quick overview of the hardware [can be found here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33459975/cosmicTrigger/DocHardware.pdf).

## Where can I find documentation?

### Always up to date

Download the whole archive and unzip it.

Install doxygen.

run "$doxygen Doxyfile" in the downloaded folder.

Go in the created "html" folder and open "index.html".

### Easier but could be outdated

The documentation is also hosted at [CERN](http://delcourt.web.cern.ch/delcourt/CosmicTrigger/doc/).

It probably won't be updated a lot, but it's much easier to use!
